# Cryptocurrency Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing cryptocurrency data by pulling data from a public API, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing the findings.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.
- **Requests**: To make API calls and retrieve cryptocurrency data.
- **json**: To work with json data received from API.

## Features

- Retrieves cryptocurrency data from a public API.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
- Visualizes key metrics and insights using various plotting techniques.

## Purpose

This project was developed to deepen my understanding of cryptocurrency data analysis and visualization. By pulling real-time data from an API, I aimed to practice data manipulation, analysis techniques, and create insightful visualizations to present the findings.

## Important Note

Always be mindful of the API usage limits and terms of service when working with public APIs. This project is for educational purposes only. The key that was used to fetch data from API was gained by creating a free account on API's website.
